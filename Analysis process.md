## **Exploratory Data Analysis :**
#### Following analysis steps has been perfromed in the dataset using Numpy/Pandas (python libraries)
    1. The total number of orders and the average order value.
    2. Determine the most popular product category.
    3. Analyze the distribution of order values using a histogram.
    4. Investigate if there's a difference in average order value by payment method.
    5. Assess the frequency of each delivery status.
    6. Determine the average number of orders per customer.
    7. Analyze the relationship between order value and delivery days using a scatter plot.
    8. Explore which day of the week has the highest number of orders.
    9. Find out the Delivery date for Each order

#### checking for 68-95-99.7 rule:
The 68-95-99.7 rule, also known as the empirical rule, is a guideline for how data is distributed in a normal distribution. The rule states that:
* 68% of the data points will fall within one standard deviation of the mean
* 95% of the data points will fall within two standard deviations of the mean
* 99.7% of the data points will fall within three standard deviations of the mean
* 
Thus, examined if the distribution of Order_Value in the E-commerce orders dataset adheres to the 68-95-99.7 rule, which is a characteristic of a normal distribution
