### 68-95-99.7 rule:
The 68-95-99.7 rule, also known as the empirical rule, is a guideline for how data is distributed in a normal distribution. The rule states that:
* 68% of the data points will fall within one standard deviation of the mean
* 95% of the data points will fall within two standard deviations of the mean
* 99.7% of the data points will fall within three standard deviations of the mean
